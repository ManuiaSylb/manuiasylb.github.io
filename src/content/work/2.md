## Introduction

Accurate segmentation of **airways and vessels** in lung CT scans is crucial for diagnosing pulmonary diseases, planning treatments, and conducting research. Traditional image processing techniques struggle with complex anatomical structures, motivating the use of **deep learning** methods.  

In this project, we explore the use of **U-Net**, **UNTER**, and **Transformer-based models** for segmenting lung airways and vessels, highlighting performance improvements and visual results.

## Methods

### U-Net: Convolutional Neural Networks for Segmentation

The **U-Net** architecture is a widely used CNN for medical image segmentation. Its **encoder-decoder design** captures contextual information while preserving spatial resolution through skip connections.  

- **Encoder:** Extracts hierarchical features from CT slices.  
- **Decoder:** Reconstructs the segmentation mask at the original resolution.  
- **Skip connections:** Preserve fine-grained details for accurate boundaries.

U-Net performs well for general structures but can struggle with **small vessels** and **irregular airway branches**.

### UNTER: Enhanced CNN with Transformers

**UNTER** combines the strengths of CNNs and Transformers. The CNN encoder captures local features, while **Transformer layers** model long-range dependencies, improving segmentation in complex lung regions.  

- Better recognition of thin vessels and intricate branching airways.  
- More robust to noise and CT artifacts.
